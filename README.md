# find_island
This is a recursive study to find 'islands' of '1's in a sea of '0's.  The sea being a matrix.  The original question was to count how many islands there were, the smallest being a single cell with a 1 in it.  Connecting cells are only those that are neighbors vertically and horizontally.  Diagonals don't count.
